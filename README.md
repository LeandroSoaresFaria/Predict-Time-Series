## Problem
Rossmann store managers are tasked with forecasting their sales six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality and location. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.


## Solution
In this notebook, the proposed solution to the business problem was developed, where, through a Telegram bot, the user presents the store number as input and the bot responds with the total expected sales for the store at the end of six weeks.
